Wix Homebrew Tap
=====================

This is a [Homebrew][brew] tap for formulae for software developed by Wix.


Setup
-----

Using these formulae requires Homebrew and Xcode. If you
have not yet installed Homebrew, a quick summary is at the end of this
document.

Once homebrew is installed, simply run:

    brew tap wix/brew

Some of these formulae may require OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) or higher.


Use
---

To install software, just use `brew install` with the name of the formula. You
may wish to run `brew update` before hand to get the latest version of the
formulae. For example, to install the latest version of the Apple simulator utilities:

    brew update
    brew install --HEAD applesimutils

To upgrade software:

    brew update
    brew upgrade    # upgrade all software installed with Homebrew
    brew upgrade applesimutils   # update just the thrift compiler


Contributing
------------

Please file bug reports and feature requests as GitHub issues against the individual project, not this repository - however, we do accept pull requests here.

To do development on these formulae, first fork the repository on GitHub. Add
your fork as a remote to your local clone:

    cd $(brew --prefix)/Library/Taps/wix/homebrew-brew
    git remote add me git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/homebrew-brew.git
    git fetch me

To propose changes, push to your fork (e.g. with `git push me +master`) and
submit pull request on GitHub.

We follow Homebrew's [standard coding style][style].
